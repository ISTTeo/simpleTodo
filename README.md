# Simple Todo App in ReactJS

![Screenshot](Screenshot.png)

My first ReactJS app. Started by following this [awesome tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44&list=WL&index=4&t=0s).

## Functionality

Very basic app. As in the the tutorial it allows for a set of todo's and to delete them.
Your todo can be completed or not, if it's completed you can delete it and you can also delete all completed todos at once.
I added the functionality to add new todos and to save the state locally.

## Improvements I Wanna Add:
* [ ] Add Style (currently just the simple stuff)
* [ ] Add API to collect and save todo's on some cloud storage
* [X] Convert this to React Native to use on Android -> Doing this in [this rep](https://github.com/ISTeo/simpleTodoReactNative).
